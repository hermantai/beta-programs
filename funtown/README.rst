funtown
=======
`funtown` is a game that that gets the idea from `The Sims`_. It's meant to be
a very small scale project, since it will be mainly developed by one
developer, Herman Tai. It started when Herman needed to practice his Go_ skill
with `Google Cloud Platform`_. The open-ended nature of funtown makes it easy
to try out different technology that Herman wants to learn and practice
in a single project.
