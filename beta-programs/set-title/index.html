    This simple page is to let you set the title of the page, so that when
    this window is minimized in the dock (as in Mac), the title shows up when
    you hover the app. This is most useful if you use multiple tabs in a web
    browser, you then minimize the window containing the tabs, and you want to
    know what the tabs in the window are about when you hover the app.

    My use case is that I often group multiple related bookmarks for a project
    (think of a project as a task that I want to work on which requires some
    researching, Google doc writing, etc) into a folder. Then, when I work on
    that project, I use the "Open All Bookmarks in New Window" feature in the
    web browser. Most of the time, I work on several projects at a time. I
    like to minimize windows that I don't need, and the hover feature let me
    switch to a specific "project window" easily. Besides, I can set the title
    to include some status of the project, so I can back my context when I
    switch between projects.
